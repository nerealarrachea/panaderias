However, I give 3 stars because they never have change, in addition to the fact that they do not have staff to verify the entry of people and to supervise that before using the tray and the tongs they put alcohol-based gel, also not all the bread is packaged and I realized that a person entered who took a pancake with his hand and returned it 游뗷游땸. In the face of this pandemic they should have supervision in this. . I told the staff what happened and if they removed the pancake.","El personal es atento, responden siempre cualquier pregunta amablemente, el pan es bueno y sobretodo la variedad de tortas, cuentos y baguette preparados.

It is common in businesses such as stores, laundries, taquerias to display counterfeit bills of $500 or more.
Surely that is the reason for not accepting them.

Y en otros negocios hasta billetes de 500.- pesos, tambi칠n en la misma colonia cuando eres un cliente asiduo y te conocen te aceptan los billetes.
Es frecuente en los negocios como tiendas, lavander칤as, taquer칤as exhibir los billetes que les dan de $ 500.- para arriba que son falsos.
Seguramente esa es la raz칩n de no aceptarlos.
