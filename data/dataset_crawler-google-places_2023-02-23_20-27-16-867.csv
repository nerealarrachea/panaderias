The bolillo, although it is a bit small, has a highly recommendable flavor and texture.
There are some pastelillos, and within the assortment of biscuits there is Spanish bread.
The presentation of the bread can be a somewhat controversial issue, since it is in small cellophane bags that, on the one hand, can lend itself to the fact that it is not possible to know precisely how recent the piece of bread is, and on the other hand it is more hygienic because it is isolated from dust and from anyone touching it. In my opinion, it is a good option because the bakery sells a lot and that makes the bread circulate constantly, which means that the bread has to be fresh.
Parking nearby can be somewhat difficult, since this branch, unlike the Genaro García branch, does not have a parking lot.
They also sell chickens, they are good, although I prefer the ones from other of their branches.

(Original)
El pan está rico y está bien surtido. El bolillo aunque es un pco chico, tiene un sabor y textura bastante recomendables.
Hay algunos pastelillos, y dentro del surtido de bizcochos hay pan español.
La presentación del pan puede ser un tema un poco polémico, pues está en pequeñas.bolsas de celofán que por un lado.puede prestarse a que no se puede saber con precisión que tan reciente es la pieza de pan, y por otro lado es más higiénico pues está aislado del polvo y de que alguien lo toque. En mi parecer es buena opción pues la panadería vende mucho y eso hace que el pan circule constantemente, lo que hace que el pan tenga que ser reciente.
Estacionarse cerca puede ser algo difícil, pues está sucursal a diferencia de la de Genaro García no cuenta con estacionamiento.
También venden pollos, son buenos, aunque prefiero los de otras de sus sucursales.","false","0",,"5 months ago","2022-09-21T11:36:28.689Z",,,,,,"112563016896706421101","24",,,"4",,"true","0",,"5 months ago","2022-09-14T00:58:34.366Z",,,,,,"102710196956624113322","233",,,"4","(Translated by Google) The quality of the brand to access

Now, when they cut the chicken they don't even give you to choose which chicken you want, much less let you see them.
When you get home and you pretend to eat, it turns out that the chickens still have the feathers, which is gross!
And the wings look charred, they are super burned.
How is it possible that they give such terrible service, and that the chickens bring the feathers, they don't even clean them? Or what is it about?
Really, they take away the hunger from the disgust it gives.

El día de hoy, no me agrado, los bolillos bien, pero quise comprar pollos rostizados, gran error, los pollos parecen codornices de lo pequeño que están y habiendo tres personas para atender se tardan horrores, uno cobra, el otro parte los pollos pidiéndoles permiso y los embolsa y entrega, el tercero solo está de mirón.
Ahora, cuando cortan el pollo ni siquiera te dan a escoger que pollo quieres, mucho menos te dejan verlos.
Cuando llegas a tu casa y pretendes comer, resulta que los pollos todavía traen las plumas, que asco!!!
Y las alas parecen achicharradas, están súper quemadas.
Cómo es posible que den tan pésimo servicio, y que los pollos traigan las plumas, ni siquiera los limpian? O de qué se trata?

He didn't want to sell me half a chicken. He gave me the cheap excuse that after 8 PM they no longer sold them more than whole.

Will you have the 5 pesos?
-Yes of course.
-------------
Don't you have all 10?
-Of course.
-------------
Won't it carry the weight?
etc...

If you go regularly to this Lecaroz, it is common. But if by chance you don't have them (those bits of junk) or you try to pay with a high bill (200 or 500) there is trouble. And they even remark to one ""it's only 25 pesos""

They are providers and one is a consumer.

When you can help out, but whoever offers a product and/or service must also change and not complain. They open their cash register and you can see the change, but they don't want any inconvenience, the inconvenience that is charged to the customer who goes out to change as it happened to me today.

Siempre menejo el sentido común y la empatía con l@s cajer@s:

¿Tendrá los 5 pesos?
-Sí, claro.
-------------
¿No tendrá los 10?
-Cómo no.
-------------
¿No treará el peso?
etc...

Si se va habitualmente a esta Lecaroz, es lo común. Pero si de casualidad no los llevas (esos piquitos de morralla) o intentas pagar con un billete alto (200 o 500) hay molestia. Y hasta le remarcan a uno ”solo son 25 pesos""

Son proveedores y uno es consumidor.

Cuando se puede echar la mano adelante, pero el que ofrece un producto y/o servicio también debe cambiar y no quejarse. Abren su caja registradora y se les ve el cambio, pero no quieren molestias, la molestia que se cargue al cliente que sale a cambiar como hoy me paso a mí.","false","0",,"6 months ago","2022-08-01T02:28:52.004Z",,,,,,"111429165063671866043","53",,,"5","(Translated by Google) Very tasty bread and cakes

Pésimo, compre un flan y estaba todo descolorido y sin sabor tuve que ponerle lechera para que tuviera algo de sabor y también tenía como basurillas negras no se de que parecían de café y me pongo a pensar🤔 que de plano no lavaran los trastes. Cochinos huacala no vuelvo a comprar ahí además el pan no es sabroso, no he comido de ahí un pan que diga huuuy q rico.

Since it is the only bakery belonging to a commercial chain in Cuajimalpa, its popularity is understood, adding its central location, however, the only good thing is practically the ""white"" bread, referring to bolillo and telera, which as of 2022 have started to make smaller

The place is ALWAYS DIRTY I have never even seen the entrance area clean, the floor is always dirty, and the trays are brushed with the same brush with which they clean the bar where everyone puts their hands and bags.

THE EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIBLE AT SERVICE, THEY DON'T EVEN SPEAK TO YOU OR TURN TO SEE YOU. The only one who really talks to you is the one who charges, beyond that, it seems that they would all do you a favor by talking to you.
Terrible place, in addition to the fact that their white bread always takes a long time to come out, and all the bread they sell until noon is bread left over from the day before.

(Original)
PÉSIMO LUGAR PARA COMPRAR PAN
Dado que es la única panedería perteneciente a una cadena comercial en Cuajimalpa se entiende su popularidad, sumando su ubicación céntrica, sin embargo, lo único bueno prácticamente es el pan ""blanco"" refiriéndome a bolillo y telera, el cual a partir de 2022 han empezado a hacer más chico.

El lugar SIEMPRE ESTA SUCIO jamás he visto si quiera la puesta de ingreso limpia, el piso siempre está sucio, y las charolas las cepillan con el mismo cepillo con el que limpian la barra donde todos ponen sus manos y bolsas.

LAS EMPLEADAS SON PÉSIMAS ATENDIENDO, NI SIQUIERA TE DIRIGEN LA PALABRA O TE VOLTEAN A VER. La única que muy obligadamente te habla es la que cobra, más allá de eso, parece que todas te harían un favor con el hecho de hablarte.
Pésimo lugar, además de que su pan blanco siempre tarda bastante en salir, y todo el pan que venden hasta medio día es pan rezagado del día anterior.","true","0",,"3 months ago","2022-11-19T16:15:38.828Z",,,,,,"107034415383924306629","63",,,"5",,"false","0",,"3 months ago","2022-11-10T14:48:12.310Z",,,,,,"103397265288375330703","4",,,"3",,"true","0",,"3 months ago","2022-11-06T15:55:48.749Z",,,,,,"117382743078437336347","104",,,"5","(Translated by Google) Your bread is very good I like the place

It's like a combination of fast food restaurant, Mexican food and coffee shop.
They sell many of their common products, such as pizza, packages of rotisserie chicken, breads, pastries, cakes. They also have stew tacos promotions and they also sell some Mexican food dishes, such as pambazos and mixiotes, fresh waters; however, these are not advertised on their menu, they need to improve that, since only those who already know the branch know that they can order it.
Something I noticed is that when we arrived there was only one person attending, and then another two arrived, but because of that the attention was a bit slow, because it was just the time when there were many diners.
The taste of the food is acceptable and I liked that they had so much variety. It is one more option to eat inside the square.

Además tienen promociones de tacos de guisado y también venden algunos platillos de comida mexicana, como pambazos y mixiotes, aguas frescas; sin embargo estos no están anunciados en su menú, les falta mejorar eso, ya que solo los que ya conocen la sucursal saben que lo pueden pedir.
Algo que noté es que cuando llegamos solo había una persona atendiendo, ya después llegaron otras dos, pero debido a eso la atención era un poco lenta, porque justo era la hora en la que había muchos comensales.

I would like to file a complaint against this branch, located on Escuinapa street in the Pedregal neighborhood of Santo Domingo. Yesterday, Saturday afternoon, I bought pan de dulce and white bread. Today my dad eats a sweet one and comments that it tastes bitter. When we open the bread, we realize that it is full of fungus. It is a shame that a company of its size, a company with its prestige, is selling products in poor condition for human consumption, putting consumers at risk. We call corporate and they don't answer us.

We ask very carefully, put a hand in it and solve those points that, inevitably, are moving people away from constant consumption.
And already on the way, put more order in the floor staff, who, although they are friendly, always seem distracted from their work and we have to seek their attention with greater insistence.
Please rescue this branch that has a lot of potential.
Hopefully, this does not remain in one more comment.

Quisiéramos no quejarnos de esta sucursal, pues a su llegada en la colonia, esperábamos mucho de ella, ya que Lecaroz, ha sido de confianza, por lo general; en esta sucursal, al parecer el problema principal, son los panaderos, pues  se nota la rotación constante de personal, lo cual nos deja ver que el problema es administrativo, pero afectan enormemente a los consumidores y comerciantes que, nos confiamos en su producto y terminamos tratando de resolver nuestra urgencia, ya que a su vez, uno queda mal con los clientes que de igual manera, confían en nosotros.
Pedimos muy atentamente, pongan mano en ello y solucionen esos puntos que, irremediablemente, están alejando a la gente del consumo constante.
Y ya de camino, poner más orden en el personal de piso, que, aunque son amables, siempre parecen distraídos de sus labores y tenemos que buscar su atención con mayor insistencia.

La panadería Lecaroz es un lugar maravilloso para los amantes del pan recién horneado. Es difícil decidir por dónde empezar, ya que todo en su tienda es delicioso.

En particular, sus bisquets son increíblemente sabrosos. Son suaves y esponjosos por dentro, mientras que su exterior es crujiente y dorado. Su sabor a mantequilla fresca es inolvidable, y el aroma que se desprende cuando los abres es simplemente irresistible.

Además de los bisquets, la panadería Lecaroz ofrece una gran variedad de panes, pasteles y otros productos de panadería. Todo lo que he probado aquí es fresco y de alta calidad, y se nota que se toman el tiempo de hacer cada producto con atención y cuidado.

El ambiente de la panadería es cálido y acogedor, con un personal amable y servicial que siempre está dispuesto a ayudarte a elegir los productos adecuados. También es muy limpio y organizado, lo que le da una sensación muy hogareña.

I have ordered and bought a lot from this place. At 9 at night they give some small tasting cakes, and the employees and the second supervisor which is SUPER RUDE! They agree with the employees against the customers and I have seen the employees keep those so-called tastings at the bottom of where they pack the bread. I have bought hundreds of swarms and they tell me: there was no chocolate, etc.
I have not said anything because I have a lot of patience, on Saturday I made an order for a chocolate cake and they told me that it would be delivered the next day, I came for it until after two days due to personal occupations, and they tell me that it was RUINED , they showed it to me and it was crushed, they took 5 DAYS TO MAKE ME A CAKE, 1 day! TERRIBLE, I DO NOT RECOMMEND!
I hope to be able to talk to someone so that these employees can be sanctioned, I don't want to hurt them but there are already many things.

SUCURSAL LA JOYA

He encargado y comprado muchísimo en éste lugar.  A las 9 de la noche dan unas pequeñas tortas de degustación, y a las empleadas y al segundo supervisor qué  es SÚPER GROSERO! Se ponen de acuerdo con las empleadas en contra de los clientes y he visto a las empleadas guardarse esas llamadas degustaciones en la parte de abajo de dónde empaquetan el pan. He comprado centenares de enjambres y me dicen : no hubo chocolate, etc.
No he dicho nada por qué tengo mucha paciencia, el día sábado hice un pedido de un pastel de chocolate y me dijeron que me lo entregaban al otro día, vine por el hasta pasados dos días por ocupaciones personales, y me salen con qué se ARRUINÓ, me lo enseñaron y estaba aplastado, se tomaron 5 DIAS PARA HACERME UN PASTEL, de 1 día!  TERRIBLE, NO MO RECOMIENDO!
Espero poder hablar con alguien para qué sancionen a estos empleados, no les quiero hacer mal pero ya son muchas cosas.","true","0",,"10 months ago","2022-04-12T08:35:42.161Z",,,,,,"106532901658474158816","27",,,"4",,"false","0",,"10 months ago","2022-04-11T14:25:55.154Z",,,,,,"110332222486955430683","0",,,"5",,"true","0",,"10 months ago","2022-04-10T01:01:19.182Z",,,,,,"114345944910354266343","3",,,"5",,"true","0",,"10 months ago","2022-04-05T01:20:41.110Z",,,,,,"109007938038870165310","10",,,"5",,"true","0",,"10 months ago","2022-04-04T21:11:54.230Z",,,,,,"111419022205766823067","51",,,"4","(Translated by Google) Central, fresh bread and edible and fresh pastries, good location

From 21:00 they serve you reluctantly as if they wanted you to leave to close.

Several employees without face masks or Covid protection measures lose cleaning.

Now also in the morning ""10 am"" there is no Bolillo bread either. It is incredible that a bakery, a business that traditionally starts operations very early, does not have 100% of its products with the highest turnover. There is always the excuse that ""...In 15 minutes they leave..."" At this time, nobody has that time to spare. Bad very bad because they have an oven and a bolillera machine.

Laughing: 2 coffee pots WITHOUT COFFEE READY.

Management does not seem to exist.

Increible que una panaderia deje de operar tan temprano Cierran 21:30

Desde las 21:00 te atienden de mala gana como si quisieran que te salieras para cerrar.

Pierde limpieza el local varios empleados sin cubrebocas ni medidas de protección Covid.

Ahora también por la mañana ""10 am"" tampoco hay pan Bolillo. Es increíble que en una panadería, giro que tradicionalmente inicia operaciones muy temprano, no cuente con el 100% se sus productos de mayor rotación. Siempre está la excusa de que ""...En 15 minutos salen..."" a esta hora nadie tiene ese tiempo de sobra. Mal muy mal porque tienen horno y máquina bolillera.

The baked bolillo ($2.50) has a good flavor, of course it doesn't compare to the wood-fired bolillo I've tried out of town but if you compare it to similarly priced bolillos like the one in Aurrera ($2.20), the bolillo from this bakery has better price quality.
The donuts and cheese bread I've tried are decent but the pies are very good ($14 each).

They have a wide variety of sweet bread, cakes, cookies, churros, rolls, etc. All of good size and flavor. For me the bad thing is that they wrap each piece in a cellophane bag and that generates a lot of garbage. They started doing it as a result of the pandemic, but I think it is not the most appropriate way if you think about the environmental damage that is caused. There are other ways to protect bread from exposure to viruses and bacteria without having to wrap each loaf in a bag. This branch also has a roastery.

Lo empezaron a hacer a raíz de la pandemia, pero creo que no es la forma más adecuada si se piensa en el daño ambiental que se provoca.

Pésima atención de las chicas, apenas y te contestan el saludo. Luego querían darme 20 panes en una sola bolsa, tantito se movían y se caían, cuando le dije que si podía ponerme la en 2 bolsas me dijo que no, que cabían bien los 20 panes ahí y ya le dije que se me iban a caer por que iba en moto,  bien de mala gana agarro otra bolsa y los hecho casi aventandolos. Primera y última vez que voy ahí, prefiero las panaderías locales, excelente servicio, atención y sabores riquísimos. Les recomiendo la de Casa Nueva y Salitrillo por la gasolinera.","true","0",,"2 months ago","2022-12-07T04:02:04.198Z",,,,,,"101630655463601369140","29",,,"2","(Translated by Google) The attention of the staff is lousy, I bought pastries and the chocolate is of the worst quality.

One day I went for bread there was a whole tower full of trays of bolillo and when trying to grab rolls one of the very rude workers began to drag the tower and told me in a dry and sharp way there is no more bread. And what was all that then? Sure there must be an explanation, however it was easier for her to be rude.

I have tried very tasty sweet bread in the area and especially the bread from there often comes out dry and looks like days.

Rotisserie chicken is very tasty and cheap.

(Original)
La atención y el trato depende del humor de las trabajadoras,  a veces es excelente y a veces es muy grosero.  Un día fui por pan había toda una torre llena de Charolas de bolillo y al intentar agarrar bolillos una de las trabajadoras muy grosera empezó a arrastrar la torre y me dijo de forma seca y cortante ya no hay pan.  ¿Y todo eso que era entonces?  Seguro debía haber una explicación,  sin embargo fue más fácil para ella ser grosera.

He probado pan de dulce muy rico por la zona y en especial el pan de ahí muchas veces sale seco y parece de días.

El pollo rostizado está muy rico y barato.","true","0",,"6 months ago","2022-08-14T19:10:10.969Z",,,,,,"111311976449313493704","283",,,"4","(Translated by Google) Very good option saved the bolillos, I don't know for what reason, they are only good the day they come out, the next day they lost everything, flavor, consistency, everything, I don't know if it's just the branch's problem, otherwise very good .

I love this chain of bakeries and have never had any problems. It seems that in this Lecaroz only the remains of the surrounding branches serve. I have had several bad experiences.
Buy spoiled cakes, and the policy is that you have to bring more than 85%-90% of the cake in for a claim to be made. Obviously one doesn't get that opportunity at special events as the guests find out about the state of the money they start trying it out.
The chocolate from this branch is a disgrace, I have cut it in half and compared it with those from branches like the one in Huipulco where it is fresh and has enough chocolate, but this one has a small strip less than half a centimeter wide.
Buying the almond croissant, one of my favorites, is quite a risk, sometimes it comes hard and bitter and sometimes if it's fresh, its texture is soft in other stores, that's why I notice the difference so much.
Obviously, the administrators ignore any claim and do not give any opportunity for clarification, nor do they show interest in improving their quality.
It's a shame since the brand has always been to my liking and this branch is closer to me than the others, plus the other employees are friendly and attentive, although they can't do much to support you in situations where the bread is spoiled. It is a terrible image that this branch gives to such a good brand

Es una pena que está sucursal sirvan el pan en tan mal estado. Me encanta esta cadena de panaderías y en ninguna he tenido inconvenientes. Parece que en este Lecaroz solo sirven los restos de las sucursales aledañas. He tenido varias experiencias malas.
Compre pasteles echados a perder, y la política es que debes llevar más de 85% -90% del pastel para que se pueda hacer un reclamo.  Obviamente uno no tiene esa oportunidad en eventos especiales , puesto que los invitados se dan cuenta del estado gasta que comienzan a probarlo.
El chocolatín de está sucursal es una desgracia, lo he partido a la mitad y comparado con los de sucursales cómo la de huipulco dónde es fresco y tiene suficiente chocolate, pero este tiene una tira pequeña de menos de medio centímetro de ancho.
Comprar el croissant de almendras, uno se mis favoritos, es todo un riesgo, a veces viene duro y amargo y a veces si está fresco, su textura es suave en otras sucursales por eso noto tanto la diferencia.
Obviamente los administradores hacen caso omiso a cualquier reclamo y no dan oportunidad de ninguna aclaración, tampoco demuestran interés por mejorar su calidad.
Es una lastima ya que la marca siempre ha Sido de mi agrado y está sucursal me queda más cerca que las otras, además los demás  trabajados son amables y atentos aunque tampoco pueden hacer mucho por apoyarte en situaciones donde el pan está echado a perder.

They mix the old bolillos with the new ones or the manager or person in charge, a Mr. with white hair, reheats the bolillos that have been going on for days. It remains to mention that due to the lack of rotation of their bread, on some occasion I had a ciabatta that had fungus.

Better take this review to improve Rome, pay attention to what your people do in the store, even the treatment of customers is very impolite, just look at the line that becomes disorganized, people don't know where to train and you know what...

My recommendation is that you do not buy in this place, look for options, we pay, we do not ask for anything as a gift, these people have to educate themselves to treat us well, if it were up to me, I would not give them one star, but it is the only way to comment on this site.
